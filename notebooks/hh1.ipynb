    "      This is what I will have them code, but for the example might be better to stick with what is in the book. Might talk about what it means to be a \"solution.\" And also might point out the similarity to regression equations and dependent and independent variables. Helps them see they sort of already \"know\" this stuff. Could try to elicit this as a question. For answers they could talk about fixing \"y\" or we could see how we want the two sides to be equal, and this means if we subtract one from the other the difference (sounds like differential; sounds like derivative) should be zero.\n",
